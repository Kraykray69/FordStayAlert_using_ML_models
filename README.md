# ML-Models-For-FordStayAlert
This project applies various machine learning models to the FordStayAlert dataset, which aims to detect driver drowsiness. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of multiple algorithms. The repository provides scripts and instructions to run and evaluate each model's performance.
